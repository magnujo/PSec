Flyt alt over i et seperat projekt. Husk library mappen!

Future work:
Make more pw complexity requirements and recommendation (dont use dictionary words, use capital and non cap letters,
use numbers and symbols)
Make it impossible to use same pw as master and as key. This will make it so if a hacker gets cracks the master they
can still not decrypt.
Make it impossible to have 2 keys with the same pw: Doesnt make sense. u might aswell have 1 key then, because if that
key gets cracked all your other keys with that pw is comprimised.
Make more stuff private.
